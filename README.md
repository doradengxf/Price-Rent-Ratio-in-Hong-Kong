## Price-Rent-Ratio-in-Hong-Kong

This project is to find the trend of house price and rent in Hong Kong. The result shows the house price and rent are incresaing year by year.
The real estate price and rent among Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and New Territories are different. (HK>KL>NT)

I use price-to-rent ratio as a main factor. From the heat map, we can see the price-rent-ratio is creasing from 1999 to 2021.
A price-to-rent ratio of 21 or more suggests itâ€™s better to rent than buy. Obviously, Hong Kong's price-to-rent ratio is too high and buying real estate will burden youths.

There provide two hypothesis tests
One is test the correlation between price-to-rent ratio and CPI(Comsumer Price Index) and another is the correlation between population total and price-to-rent ratio.

There are three methods to test which are p-value test, confidence interval test and critical value test.
